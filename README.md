# Job_recommend_ML_python
this is job recommendation project based on machine learning using similiarity.

I used streamlit for run the project.
I will open in brwoser and select any profile then recommend you at most 20 jobs with same profile/skill

we need to install pandas version less than 2.0.0
similarly install numpy.

then data cleanning using NLP in juypitar notebook
and store in df.pkl file and clean data into similarity.pkl file

the run command for this project is "streamlit run app.py"

As Im not expert in ML/AI. but still i give my best R&D and try to accomplish the task.
